- My main responsibilities are to study, implement and tune new models for the machine learning projects of the company
- My work, together with the other members of the team, starts with the exploration and the analysis of the data that we have (millions of rows per day) with python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, etc.
- It ends with the development of the final machine learning model (using TensorFlow, Keras or scikit-learn) ready to be deployed in production (we use GCP products for serving our models in a distributed and scalable fashion).
